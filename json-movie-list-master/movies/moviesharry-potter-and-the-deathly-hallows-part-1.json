The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them.

Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him, but as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe legend of the Deathly Hallows.",
