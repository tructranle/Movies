    "storyline": "Cyril falls head over heel for the new girl in his class. Roxy is drop dead gorgeous and she is cool. But there is a problem. Cyril is terribly self conscious because he's got a rather large nose. And while he writes songs for and about his beloved, he is too shy to let her know they are his and pretends they were written by the hunky Rick whom he presumes Roxy must admire. And if he has not chances with the lovely, he'd rather she go out with dim witted Rick than with that macho Benno.",
